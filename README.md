# Frontend-contacts-page
Just a front end preview of a contacts page made with react.js


So this was my first github push i tried on my own and i ended up losing the files i coded somehow.
I couldn't push to the master so i created a fork and tried to push it to a branch.

I will make a much complex web app and learn to make the right commits later in the day.
